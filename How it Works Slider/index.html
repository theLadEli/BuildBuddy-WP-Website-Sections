        <p>
          Your drawings detail the shell of your extension. What goes into the space you’re creating such as the type of
          flooring, lighting, heating etc. are referred to as your “Specifications”. These details are important as it
          gives your builders the full scope of work involved so that they can provide you with an accurate quote.
          Selecting your Specifications with BuildBuddy is an easy-to-follow step-by-step process. Guidance is provided
          along the way to help you make more informed decisions. Once you’re done you will have a detailed scope of
          work to share with builders.

        <p>
          Once your specifications and product selections are complete, you're ready to request quotes from builders.
          Providing a comprehensive project breakdown removes the guesswork and enables your builder to provide a
          precise quote. This clarity makes comparisons between quotes much easier and eliminates unforeseen costs.
          Builders love this about BuildBuddy—it simplifies communication and ensures they're fully aligned with your
          vision.

        </div>

        <p>
          Once you know what is going to be included within the scope of your extension then it’s time to start the
          product selection process. A typical single-storey extension will require you to purchase between 50-100
          different products, from light fittings to kitchen appliances, flooring and much more. BuildBuddy turns this
          complex task into a seamless process, helping you find products that fit your specifications and budget.

        <p>
          Your build quotes and product selections form the main components of your extension cost. You can now start
          budgeting for the total cost of your extension and easily see where you are up to with your spend. Stay in
          control of your costs by updating your budget as your project progresses and avoid unexpected cost overruns.
